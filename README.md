The Intelligent ID Photo Generation System is designed to automate the process of creating standardized ID photos. The system leverages image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to ensure the photos meet various official requirements for size, background, and facial position.
## Overview

The Intelligent ID Photo Generation System is designed to automate the process of creating standardized ID photos. The system leverages image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to ensure the photos meet various official requirements for size, background, and facial position.

## Features

- **Automatic Background Removal:** Automatically removes the background from the uploaded photo and replaces it with a standard background color.
- **Facial Recognition:** Detects facial features to ensure the face is properly aligned and sized according to official guidelines.
- **Size Adjustment:** Adjusts the photo size to meet the specific requirements of different ID types.
- **Quality Enhancement:** Enhances the quality of the photo to ensure clarity and sharpness.
- **Multi-Format Support:** Supports multiple output formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
